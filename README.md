# AdventOfCode 2021

This repository contains my solution to the puzzles of Advent of Code 2021 ( https://adventofcode.com/2021/). All solutions are written in python. 
The default way to run each script is to have both, input and python file folders, in the same root folder. Hpwever other paths can be chosen in the initialisation functions of all solutions.
